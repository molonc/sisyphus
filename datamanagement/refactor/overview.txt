Class for GSC/BRC import for DLP/TenX

- GSC DLP import
- GSC TenX import
- BRC DLP import
- BRC TenX import

Common Aspects

- Querying GSC API and fetching result
- Upload data to Azure
- Create/update/track data on Colossus and Tantalus


BRC Import
Data retrieval (manual):
	Get email from BRC/collaborators
	rsync data over
	BCL to FASTQ with sanity check?  (samplesheet.txt created from colossus, manually creates the mapping, identify library)
	SANITY CHECK: Confirm with wet lab if any "funny pooling" happened at BRC, i.e. they can pool our pools
Import
	BRC specific "Preprocessing"
	Fill in lanes on sequencing object
	Split lanes back into libraries (i.e. multiple lanes may be same library)
	Put data into Azure
	Create tantalus input dataset objects PER library

GSC Import

Import
	GSC specific "Preprocessing"
